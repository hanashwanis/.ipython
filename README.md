**Project Overview**
This project implements an Object Detection system using Computer Vision and Deep Learning to identify and localize objects in images and live camera feeds.
The model detects multiple objects simultaneously by drawing bounding boxes and assigning class labels with confidence scores.

**Features**
Detects multiple objects in a single image
Draws bounding boxes with labels and confidence
Supports image-based inference
Supports live camera (webcam) inference
Trained on a custom / standard dataset
Uses transfer learning for better accuracy

**Live Inference (Webcam Detection)**
The project supports real-time object detection using a webcam.
Live Detection Features:
Captures frames from camera
Runs object detection on each frame
Displays bounding boxes in real-time

**Results**
Successfully detects multiple objects
High accuracy on validation data
Works in real-time with webcam input

**Future Enhancements**
Improve accuracy with larger datasets
Deploy as a web application
Add object tracking
Optimize for mobile devices
